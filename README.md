This is the repository for the UWF Sevil Research Group's Traversability Assessment of Unstructured Environments Through Image Segmentation and Path Planning. 

Our goal is to segment an image of an outdoor off road location into traversable and non-traversable surfaces. Then, the system will plan a viable path through the area and the platform will execute the path.
The steps to run these files and view the results yourself are listed below. These are subject to change as research progresses.
